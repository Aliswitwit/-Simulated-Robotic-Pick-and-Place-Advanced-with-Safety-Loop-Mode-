# -Simulated-Robotic-Pick-and-Place-Advanced-with-Safety-Loop-Mode-
This ladder logic project simulates a robotic pick-and-place sequence with integrated safety interlocks, emergency stop, and an automatic loop mode. The cycle performs arm extension, gripper closure, and arm retraction in a timed sequence.
